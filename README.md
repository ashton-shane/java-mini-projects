This repository is where I store the mini projects as I learn Java. <br>

**PROJECT 1: HELLO WORLD** <br>
A simple Hello World project where I learned how IntelliJ's project file structures and configurations worked and how to run a Java program. 
Connected Git and Github to IntelliJ.

**PROJECT 2: CALCULATE AREA** <br>
A project that calculates either the area of a square or a triangle. I am practising taking in user input and type casting / conversions and
creating helper methods in Java.

**PROJECT 3: NUMBER GUESSING GAME** <br>
A mini-game that allows the user to either guess a random roll of a normal die from 1-6 OR to guess from a 10-sided die with numbers ranging from 1-100.
Numbers for the weird die are randomly generated and populated in an array. Practising for loops, do-while loops, and arrays.
